The genius of the app is that they rolled out a \"Kitty Connect\" level builder a while back, and there are tons of people building games in this world. And many of them are geniuses! There was this guy named \"Fomb\" who built the best game levels of any game I’ve ever seen. And then a couple months ago now, he retired. I wonder what he’s putting all his energy into now. He’s a really remarkable thinker. (I realize that’s a big thing to say about someone who builds platform game levels.)",
