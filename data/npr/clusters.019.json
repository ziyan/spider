        "content": "Heading into Friday s news conference President Obama had a delicate balancing act before him how to acknowledge widespread concerns about National Security Agency surveillance without in any way legitimizing the actions of leaker Edward Snowden The best course the president decided was to acknowledge that Snowden s revelations to some degree forced his administration to accelerate and expand a review of the federal government s surveillance activities But Obama wanted to make clear that he not some random event set in motion the administration s policy review even before details of the NSA data gathering involving phone records and Internet communications became public The president sought to rip off the hero s mantle some have placed on Snowden after his leaks began appearing in the Guardian newspaper I don t think Mr Snowden was a patriot The fact is is that Mr Snowden s been charged with three felonies It also was a fact however and Obama spoke to it that Snowden s disclosures did push the administration in ways it would have avoided if it could have There s no doubt that Mr Snowden s leaks triggered a much more rapid and passionate response than would have been the case if I had simply appointed this review board to go through and I d sat down with Congress and we had worked this thing through The president reminded his audience of his May speech when he addressed the use of drones and targeted killings in U S counterterrorism efforts It was then before Snowden became a household name that the president told the nation he had ordered a broad examination of the government surveillance But Obama s May message the essence of which was we ve got this and the assurances since then clearly haven t tamped down enough of the fears or criticisms Americans have become significantly less trusting of government assurances on civil liberties the more 9 11 recedes into the background A recent Pew Research Center survey found half of Americans approving government anti terrorism programs that collect telephone and Internet data with 44 percent disapproving But for the first time since Pew Research began tracking it in 2004 Americans expressed more concern about restrictions of civil liberties going too far than protection from terrorism And in a remarkable change since 2006 Pew found the same percentage of Democrats and Republicans 38 percent who agreed that the government s policies didn t go far enough to protect Americans There was a 9 percentage point difference in 2006 Part of what we seemed to be witnessing with Obama was the education of a president and the difference between having the ultimate responsibility of protecting the nation and being a legislator in the policymaking process As Obama himself acknowledged again Friday when he was a senator during the Bush administration he thought somewhat differently Now keep in mind that as a senator I expressed a healthy skepticism about these programs he said He gave the strong impression that knowing what he now knows from sitting in the Oval Office his inclinations run in a different direction Still he understood that though he may have thought the existing checks and balances were enough to assure Americans he now realizes they re not In explaining that he now gets it the president arrived at what may have been one of the stranger metaphors he s used in some time invoking the first lady and household chores It was a jarring version of Ronald Reagan s trust but verify and a comparison unlikely to come out of the presidential cupboard again But the point was made",

        "content": "As the supply chain that delivers our food to us gets longer and more complicated many consumers want to understand and control where their food comes from But even if we meet farmers at the farmers market urban consumers are still largely divorced from the people who grow pick and package our food And we may even willfully ignore their suffering argues Seth Holmes a medical anthropologist and professor of health and social behavior at the University of California Berkeley in his provocative new book Fresh Fruit Broken Bodies For two summers between 2003 and 2005 Holmes lived on a farm in the Skagit Valley of Washington state The farm produces strawberries apples raspberries and blueberries to sell to berry companies like Driscoll and dairy companies like H agen Dazs He traveled there with a group of Triqui Indians across the border from their hometown of San Miguel in Oaxaca Mexico As Holmes soon learned the Triquis make up the very bottom rung of the agricultural labor ladder and earn between 5 000 to 8 000 a year Holmes stayed in the camp with the other laborers in a shack with a tin roof and no insulation Over the winter he traveled with the Triquis to Madera Calif to prune grapevines in a vineyard In 2005 Holmes went back to medical school but he has continued to visit the same workers nearly every year since On the berry farm Holmes picked fruit once or twice a week the Triqui workers picked seven days a week rain or shine without a day off And that took a heavy toll on their bodies back and knee pain slipped disks Type 2 diabetes premature births As one Triqui worker he calls Abelino told him You pick with your hands bent over kneeling your back hurts you get knee pains and hip pains You suffer a lot We talked to Holmes about his time with the Triquis here s part of our conversation edited for brevity and clarity What was the most surprising or shocking aspect of the food system that you uncovered in your research Before I did the research I had a sense of the hierarchy of people involved in the food labor chain But over the course of the first five months it became clear that the hierarchy is much more detailed and subtle There are indigenous Mexicans like the Triqui who occupy the rung with the most demanding physical labor they re the ones who are bent over picking The mestizos operate the machines that s not quite as demanding Then the U S born Latinos are in charge of some things and use English and Spanish The white Americans have the most control What was troubling was that people on every rung of hierarchy are legitimizing and justifying it Farmworkers are doing that too Do you think that hierarchy is representative of farms in other states in the U S I think it is The indigenous people from Mexico and Central America have the least powerful position The system is different in California because farms tend to hire a contractor to get big fields picked or pruned The contractor goes out and finds laborers and in my field research I found that system to be worse in the sense that farmworkers are not paid directly by the farm There s no paper trail When we were in California every time we pruned we were paid less than minimum wage With that system labor laws are less likely to be enforced But in Washington state the farmworkers were hired directly by farmers who were more likely to pay minimum wage Do you think that the American public cares about the labor required to produce our food We talk so little about the people who do the work that gives us the fresh fruit and vegetables that we want Farmworkers are pretty hidden and there s a concept from Jean Paul Sartre the French philosopher called bad faith meaning self deception My simplified version of that is that we consciously hide from ourselves the difficult realities of the workers We somewhat know them but we don t think about them much In that way it seems like communal bad faith Why do you think the people in the food movement calling for changes in the industrial food system don t talk much about the labor issues On some level a lot of the food movement is concerned with How does this food affect me and my body Are there hormones in it Antibiotics Pesticides But the workers who are harvesting the food and spraying the pesticides their bodies are human too Ideally we would think about them and what s going into that work If there are ways that we as consumers can lend a voice towards farmworkers having health care that will protect the bodies that are working so hard to give us the healthy food we can eat I think that s really important So you think the health care available to farmworkers is deficient In Washington state and California the people I met were pretty lucky to have independently run grant funded nonprofit clinics to go to But it s unclear what will happen with the Affordable Care Act The law is wonderful in lots of ways and will increase access for a lot of people but there are no provisions for immigrants Meanwhile immigration reform is stalled and it looks like part of the reason is that several representatives won t vote for reform unless newly legalized immigrants will not be eligible for full health care But the people who are getting sick to help us get a healthy diet deserve health care It s clear from the book that you don t really blame the farm owners for the poor living and working conditions of berry pickers As you write The corporatization of U S agriculture and the growth of international free markets squeeze growers such that they cannot easily imagine increasing the pay of the pickers or improving the labor camps without bankrupting the farm many of the most powerful inputs into the suffering of farmworkers are structural not willed by individuals Sometimes it is fair for us to blame farm owners But sometimes it isn t We also have to look at the North American Free Trade Agreement and other free trade agreements In general the problems in agriculture are long standing What do you think is the most important thing for consumers to know about the people behind their food Farmworkers help us be healthy by harvesting fruits and vegetables and they re helping the health of our economy by paying sales taxes and Social Security But we are not prone to value their health or bodies or well being That seems disrespectful and unfair",

        "content": "Tyson Foods Inc announced this week that it would soon suspend purchases of cattle that had been treated with a controversial drug citing animal welfare concerns But many in the industry wonder if the real reason is the battle for sales in other countries where certain drugs that make livestock grow faster are banned I really do think this is more of a marketing ploy from Tyson to raise some awareness so they can garner some export business from our overseas export partners says Dan Norcini an independent commodities broker Surprising many in the industry Tyson sent a letter to cattle feeders saying that as of Sept 6 the company would no longer buy animals that had been treated with Zilmax a drug that bulks up cattle by as much as 30 pounds just before slaughter Tyson controls 26 percent of the U S beef supply and is the first company in the industry to make this change The letter cited recent reports of cattle being delivered for processing that couldn t walk or move We do not know the specific cause of these problems but some animal health experts have suggested that the use of the feed supplement Zilmax also known as zilpaterol is one possible cause the letter said adding that it wasn t a food safety issue The company that manufactures Zilmax Merck Animal Health issued a statement saying the product is safe We are surprised by Tyson s letter the statement said We are confident that based on all of the available data on Zilmax the experience reported by Tyson is not attributable to Zilmax Zilmax approved by the FDA for use in livestock is a beta agonist and acts as a steroid turning fat into muscle As the Chronicle of Higher Education reported in 2012 the drug can make meat tough and tasteless But new reports have surfaced recently suggesting that cattle are growing so large up to 1 300 pounds that they can t walk Lilly Callaway an animal scientist who works for JBS the largest beef producing company in the world told a meeting of cattle producers in Denver this week that her company is seeing increasing reports of animals fed beta agonists as stressed Truck drivers have indicated that there is a difference between loading cattle depending on the beta agonist status of the diet she told Feedstuffs a weekly agribusiness newspaper Our plants have indicated that particular lots of cattle are showing up as tender footed they do not want to move seem lethargic and stiff and have no energy Mike Callicrate a Kansas cattle rancher and president of the Organization for Competitive Markets a small group of beef producers fighting consolidation of the industry says he wasn t surprised by Tyson s move Consumers are growing increasingly aware of how their food is produced he says and they don t like what the use of what he calls performance enhancing drugs to dope livestock The Lance Armstrong baseball player type of compounds are precisely the same compounds being used in livestock production he says We have killed our export markets with the use of all these growth promoting growth enhancing performance enhancing type drugs China Russia and many countries in the European Union have banned the use of these drugs in meat production In May Smithfield Foods the largest pork producer in the world announced it would cut in half its purchase of animals raised with a similar drug ractopamine Just a week later Smithfield announced its sale to a Chinese company Patty Lovera assistant director of Food and Water Watch in Washington D C says she hopes that large companies barring the use of such drugs will become a trend It s a little bit unfortunate that it takes other countries having good standards to make an improvement in the U S marketplace she said but at this point we ll take what we can get I think when it comes to how we look at the drugs that are allowed to be given to food animals But not everyone is happy about Tyson s decision The last few years have been tough on cattle ranchers and farmers They ve suffered through drought drying up their hay and grass then watched as that weather killed off corn and sent feed prices sky high Norcini the commodities broker says Zilmax was a godsend to producers allowing them to feed the cattle less and get a better price thanks to the added pounds He thinks Tyson is taking a big risk They may appease or they may keep some people happy in the animal rights front They may gain some followers and some accolades from that he says But I think the cattle industry as a whole is not going to look at this particularly in a good light Meanwhile Lovera and others wonder if Tyson is simply sending a message to all those countries now negotiating two large trade agreements with the U S This stuff is front and center in these trade negotiations so I just think it s really interesting to see a big player like this volunteer some change probably to make export markets happy she says Peggy Lowe is a reporter for Harvest Public Media a public radio reporting collaboration that focuses on agriculture and food production",
