        "content": "Heading into Friday s news conference President Obama had a delicate balancing act before him how to acknowledge widespread concerns about National Security Agency surveillance without in any way legitimizing the actions of leaker Edward Snowden The best course the president decided was to acknowledge that Snowden s revelations to some degree forced his administration to accelerate and expand a review of the federal government s surveillance activities But Obama wanted to make clear that he not some random event set in motion the administration s policy review even before details of the NSA data gathering involving phone records and Internet communications became public The president sought to rip off the hero s mantle some have placed on Snowden after his leaks began appearing in the Guardian newspaper I don t think Mr Snowden was a patriot The fact is is that Mr Snowden s been charged with three felonies It also was a fact however and Obama spoke to it that Snowden s disclosures did push the administration in ways it would have avoided if it could have There s no doubt that Mr Snowden s leaks triggered a much more rapid and passionate response than would have been the case if I had simply appointed this review board to go through and I d sat down with Congress and we had worked this thing through The president reminded his audience of his May speech when he addressed the use of drones and targeted killings in U S counterterrorism efforts It was then before Snowden became a household name that the president told the nation he had ordered a broad examination of the government surveillance But Obama s May message the essence of which was we ve got this and the assurances since then clearly haven t tamped down enough of the fears or criticisms Americans have become significantly less trusting of government assurances on civil liberties the more 9 11 recedes into the background A recent Pew Research Center survey found half of Americans approving government anti terrorism programs that collect telephone and Internet data with 44 percent disapproving But for the first time since Pew Research began tracking it in 2004 Americans expressed more concern about restrictions of civil liberties going too far than protection from terrorism And in a remarkable change since 2006 Pew found the same percentage of Democrats and Republicans 38 percent who agreed that the government s policies didn t go far enough to protect Americans There was a 9 percentage point difference in 2006 Part of what we seemed to be witnessing with Obama was the education of a president and the difference between having the ultimate responsibility of protecting the nation and being a legislator in the policymaking process As Obama himself acknowledged again Friday when he was a senator during the Bush administration he thought somewhat differently Now keep in mind that as a senator I expressed a healthy skepticism about these programs he said He gave the strong impression that knowing what he now knows from sitting in the Oval Office his inclinations run in a different direction Still he understood that though he may have thought the existing checks and balances were enough to assure Americans he now realizes they re not In explaining that he now gets it the president arrived at what may have been one of the stranger metaphors he s used in some time invoking the first lady and household chores It was a jarring version of Ronald Reagan s trust but verify and a comparison unlikely to come out of the presidential cupboard again But the point was made",

        "content": "Sen Mitch McConnell undoubtedly had no illusions that he would be the ideal candidate of Tea Party conservatives Still the Republican leader in the Senate couldn t have expected what sounds like disdain from his own campaign manager Between you and me I m sorta holding my nose for two years because what we re doing here is going to be a big benefit to Rand Paul in 16 So that s my long vision Jesse Benton the campaign manager said during a phone call secretly recorded early this year by a conservative activist and recently published by Economic Policy Journal Benton a libertarian has been a top campaign aide to both Ron Paul the former congressman from Texas and his son the junior senator from Kentucky who is talked of as a possible presidential candidate Benton is also married to a granddaughter of the elder Paul Benton hired by McConnell 11 months ago was supposed to be the Senate minority leader s emissary to Tea Party conservatives especially now that he tries to get past a primary challenge from businessman Matt Bevin Benton s words could prove damaging to McConnell if it gives enough Kentucky conservatives one more reason to vote against the four term incumbent And Benton tried to clean up the political mess in a statement released by the McConnell campaign All in all it s not easy being McConnell right about now He is viewed by many conservatives including evidently his campaign manager as an establishment Republican too ready to make deals with Democrats If it s too much for him to both grin and bear the diss by Benton he at least has to bear it Firing Benton would inflame exactly the voters McConnell was hoping Benton could soothe So that doesn t appear to be an option He also has a feisty Republican primary foe who could require McConnell to burn through a lot of his 10 million war chest and if the senator succeeds soften him up for the Democrat And that Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes recently showed that she can deliver a devastating attack line when she said McConnell couldn t even pass a kidney stone But more painful than that for McConnell might be a recent poll albeit by a Democratic pollster that found Grimes and McConnell essentially tied Still it s early and McConnell is an experienced political infighter While The Cook Political Report has moved the race to toss up status Larry Sabato s Crystal Ball still favors McConnell to win the race",

        "content": "Lee Daniels has directed critically acclaimed films that deal with difficult subject matter before but he says working on The Butler was the hardest thing he s ever done The film chronicles the life of a man who rose from the cotton fields of North Carolina to work in the White House witnessing some of the most important moments in this nation s history The movie s main character Cecil Gaines is loosely based on the life of Eugene Allen who worked at the White House for over three decades Allen and his wife Helene were profiled by Washington Post writer Wil Haygood during the 2008 presidential election Daniels and Haygood sat down with Tell Me More host Michel Martin to talk about The Butler and the man who inspired it all On the search for a witness In the midst of the 2008 presidential campaign journalist Wil Haygood had a feeling that Barack Obama was going to win And he wanted to profile someone who had witnessed the civil rights movement from the 1960s to the present time I just knew it was going to exhaust the hell out of me Haygood says I was just looking for anybody a butler a maid somebody who washed the windows Haygood made call after call searching for someone who would fit the bill Eventually he struck gold with Eugene Allen I was under the impression he had worked for three presidents He corrected me and he said it was eight On the story s relationship with the civil rights era Although it delves into the civil rights movement Daniels says that wasn t his initial intention This story is really a love affair for me A father son love affair that transcended race It wasn t until we started shooting some of the atrocities that happened in the South that I realized that this was on another level Daniels described one scene in particular that stood out for him We were shooting the bus scene there were freedom riders on the bus It was hot it was a real bus and I m in the center of the bus with these kids on a bridge where black men were lynched Daniels says that after yelling action actors playing the role of KKK members stormed the bus carrying burning crosses and yelling insults I m a little scared and I think so were the actors on the bus and I yell to the window cut But they can t hear me says Daniels And I realize when it happened there was no one to yell cut for these children and that these kids were really fighting for the soul of our country and that they were heroes in a way that I could never be That s when I realized it was a bigger movie than just a father son story It s not a movie it s a movement On why the story is relevant today Daniels says that when he makes a movie he goes into a cocoon and often disconnects from the outside world and news of the day to focus on painting an accurate historical picture But he noted that the film s conversations about race are still relevant today I come out and Trayvon Martin is happening It s out of body It leaves me speechless I m at a sense of loss because I did the movie we end on hope Cecil walking down and Obama s speaking and this glorious music and those iconic words from those presidents are inundating us and you know where are we On what the movie would mean to Eugene Allen Allen died in 2010 and wasn t able to see the film inspired by his life make it to the big screen But Haygood thinks there s still something beautiful about that To me it s almost biblical The last shall be first The movie is about the butler He s up in heaven He can tell President Eisenhower Truman Kennedy Johnson Carter Ford Nixon Reagan He can tell them Hey we re having a movie in the theater of heaven tonight It s called Lee Daniels The Butler and it s really not about any eight of you it s about the guy who used to serve you the popcorn at the White House theater It s about me Have a seat I think that s beautiful",
