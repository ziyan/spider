BOOZE will be flowing until 5am tonight after dozens of Queensland's licensed venues received special permission to stay open late for New Year's Eve.

The state has granted extra hours to nearly 50 bars and clubs, with half open until dawn.

Liquor Licensing Minister Peter Lawlor said it "made sense" for venues to trade later because New Year's Eve was a big celebration.

Bars and clubs normally close between 2am and 3am.

Mr Lawlor said all premises can trade until 2am – regardless of licence. Patrons must finish drinks and leave by 2.30am.

Venues that wanted extra hours applied to Liquor Licensing by early December.

Of the about 50 that applied, half wanted to stay open until 5am.

Meanwhile, Queensland police will boost its enforcement to control alcohol-fuelled violence.

Alcohol-fuelled violence has been a major issue in Queensland, with multiple fatalities from king hits, stabbings and glassings.
